## Sharing simulation models

Nine out of ten healthcare DES publications do not share the code for their model. ^[Monks, T., & Harper, A. (2023). Computer model and code sharing practices in healthcare discrete-event simulation: a systematic scoping review. Journal of Simulation, 0(0), 1-16. [10.1080/17477778.2023.2260772](https://
doi.org/10.1080/17477778.2023.2260772)]

. . .

Models that are shared may not be reproducible. <!-- Making code open does not mean it is reproducible -->

<!--
* re run and verify findings

* maintaing trust in outputs
* support model reuse
* others build on prior work
Achieving reproducibility fosters trust and transparency, building confidence that the model behaves consistently with the original implementation. It is vital to establish reproducibility before a model is reused.

* researcher revisit and build on own analyses
Reproducibility also benefits authors by making it easier to revisit and reuse their own code, such as for updating outputs or conducting new analyses.

Finally, reproducibility often improves overall code quality. It encourages clear structure and documentation, reducing errors and ambiguities. [7] These advantages apply regardless of whether code is shared publicly or remains proprietary.

<!-- Notes:

Developing reproducible template models: I am currently creating template DES models in Python and R, hosted on GitHub, that follow a reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP). This approach, widely used in fields like public health and government analytics, ensures that analyses are scripted, version-controlled, and reproducible from raw data to final outputs. These templates will implement the recommendations from my findings - as well as the Levels of RAP framework developed by the NHS RAP Community of Practice. They will serve as practical examples to lower the barrier to entry for conducting reproducible DES research and provide a clear, replicable structure for others to follow.

2. Refining the STARS framework: The team I am part of previously developed the Sharing Tools and Artefacts for Reusable Simulations (STARS) framework, which provides guidelines for ensuring DES model reusability. Whilst STARS supports reuse, my work found it did not also ensure computational reproducibility. My findings will contribute to refining the framework to better address the practical challenges of reproducing healthcare DES models.

3. Improving the STRESS-DES framework: My supervisor developed the Strengthening the reporting of empirical simulation studies-DES (STRESS-DES) guidelines. These aim to facilitate replicability by enabling model reconstruction from a paper's description without requiring code. In my work, I found that adherence to the guidelines did not also translate to reproducibility. My findings will inform refinements to STRESS-DES that help incorporate practices necessary for computational reproducibility. Given its widespread adoption in healthcare modelling, these improvements will enhance the clarity and reproducibility of future studies following the STRESS-DES framework.
